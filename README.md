# Login and Level Selection

In this repo the frontend section of this has been implemented https://github.com/labsorg525/hiring_test?tab=readme-ov-file#frontend-developer

# Changed Files

Only Login and LevelSelectionModal folder are created in the src folder of this repo.

## Login Page

As requested in the task, I have changed the elements and styles of the login page to make it more appeal and responsive. I tried to apply a fantasy design for it.  As it was working with css modules, I didn't change the way it is working with styles and added the css variables in that file. **In the real world, it doesn't happen because we usually use styled components and do not define variables in a component. The theme is supposed to be defined globally** 

## Modal

For modal, I used Material UI which were added to the project. I used the Dialog component, styled components and MUI theming for stylings.
